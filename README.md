## Developer-Notes

> From Jeremy Zhu
* In the initial planning phase of our project, we were planning on creating an interactable travel application, however we chose to pivot to creating a freelancing services website.
    * The idea was to gain invaluable experience creating a professional-looking services website to better understand how clients and prospective freelancers interact with UI/UX design choices.
    * This project allowed us to gain some insight into how much work goes into desiging the front-end of a website.
* Learning Bulma's CSS framework was comparable in difficulty to Bootstrap's CSS framework: both are quite simple, developer friendly, and the CSS classifications were very straight forward.
    * Besides Bulma's CSS framework, I implemented my own custom CSS to fill in the gaps that Bulma did not work.
    * The overall UI/UX design of our website was heavily inspired by fiverr.
* We had a lot of ideas for our final design, but, due to technical limitations they were scrapped:
    * We had a search bar, but didn't end up using it, because we could not get it to work with our two APIs. 
    * We used a for loop to render each service card, then the append() method from jQuery, and employed template literals with backticks to insert values as needed.
    * Sites employed for styling elements: 
        * Font Awesome some icons on the site.
        * Google Fonts for the fonts on the site.
        * Flaticon for the service section on the index.html.
