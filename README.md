## Developer-Notes

> From Jeremy Zhu
* In the initial steps of creating the website, we were planning to create a travel map application, but we move to this freelancer's service idea.
    * The idea was because creating a business website let's us get a better sense of how clients who would want a product or sales wesbite to look like.
    * Let's us get the experience we felt like we need in creating the website.
* Learning Bulma's CSS framework was quite easy and friendly. Very similar to Bootstrap's framework, but the naming of the CSS classes was very straight forward.
    * Besides Bulma's CSS framework, I sed a good amount of my own CSS to clean some areas where Bulma's framework didn't work.
    * Most designs were inspired by fiverr wesbite.
* We had a lot of ideas for design, but some were scratched.
    * We had a search bar, but didn't up using it, because we haven't had a clue how to get the search bar to work with our APIs. So we just replaced it with popular buttons.
    * We used a for loop to render each service card the append() method from jQuery and using template literals with backticks to insert values as needed.
    * Looked up several sites to help
        * Font Awesome some icons on the site.
        * Google Fonts for the fonts on the site.
        * Flaticon for the service section on the index.html.
